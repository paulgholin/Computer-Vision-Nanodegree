# Computer-Vision-Udacity
This repository contains my projects for Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree. 

## Projects:

### P1 - Facial Keypoints Recognition
- Built a CNN model using Pytorch to predict facial keypoints in facial images. 

### P2 - Image Captioning 
- Built a CNN-RNN model using Pytorch for image captioning.

### P3 - SLAM Implementation
- Implemented simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for robot that moves and senses in a 2D grid world.
